#Stephen's Reflection

* I was struggling with sharing repository when working with peer prior to the GPS
* During GPS, I was clarified of making good commit messages and some git commands details and repository sharing.
* I asked the differences between `git pull origin master` and `"git fetch origin master" and "git merge origin/master"` 
* I am still unsure of exactly how to share repository when collaborating with a peer.
* My first experience of GPS was excellent, a lot of questions have been cleared up but having more questions arises after I do a mental recaps.
